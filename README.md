# The Merchant (The KÃ¸bmand)
This is a project made in school. The purpose of the project was to learn the basics of WPF and XAML, and also to create a UML class diagram.
Learning how to save and load a state was a challenge.

You "play" (it's not a real game) as a merchant and can travel between supermarket nodes to trade.
This and the ludo game are some of my first steps to learn more about application development for desktop.
